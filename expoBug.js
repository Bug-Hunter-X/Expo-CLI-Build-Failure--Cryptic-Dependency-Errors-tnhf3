This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has an outdated or incorrectly configured `package.json` file, or when there are conflicting dependencies.  The core issue stems from the Expo CLI's inability to correctly resolve or install the necessary Node modules needed for your project to function correctly.  This often manifests as errors during the build process, preventing the app from running successfully on either the emulator or a physical device.  Specific error messages can vary greatly depending on the nature of the dependency conflict.
