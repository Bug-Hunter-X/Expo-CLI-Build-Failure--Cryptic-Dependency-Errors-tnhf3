The solution involves systematically addressing potential dependency conflicts:

1. **Update Dependencies:** Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update all packages to their latest compatible versions.
2. **Check for Conflicts:** Carefully examine the `package.json` file, paying close attention to dependencies that might have conflicting version requirements.  Use a tool like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree and identify the root of the conflict.
3. **Clean and Reinstall:** Delete the `node_modules` folder (`rm -rf node_modules`) and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This ensures a clean installation of all required packages.
4. **Review Peer Dependencies:** Pay attention to `peerDependencies` in your `package.json`.  These dependencies specify compatible versions of other packages your project relies on and should be carefully met for the application to work correctly.
5. **Use a Package Manager:** Ensure consistency by using one package manager (either npm or yarn) throughout your project and avoid switching between them as this can introduce issues. If using yarn, ensure its properly setup. 
6. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Make sure your Expo SDK version is compatible with your other dependencies. Incompatibility here is another common source of cryptic errors.

If the issue persists, provide the complete error message and the relevant sections of your `package.json` file for further assistance.
